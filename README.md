# ascension-the-platformer
--A *very* short platformer game about ascending to a higher plane. What dark secrets await your platforming feet?--

This is the first game I've made.
To make it, I watched a tutorial on Youtube by 'Brackeys' called "How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial".
None of the assets in the game are mine except for the game icon.
I did add some of my own code after I had finished the tutorial, and added ideas that were not originally presented in the video.
The game is designed by me, einaienaxp.

To download the game, check out the releases for it on this repository and download the '.zip' file from there.
Here's to hoping for a more independant project and a fruitful future, lads.
